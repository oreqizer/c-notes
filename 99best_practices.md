# Best practices

A set of best practices while building **C** code.

### Variable names

Variable names are most commonly all *lowercase*, with abbreviated names being the most common (e.g. `isallnum` says whether all elements are numbers).

Symbolic constants are all *UPPERCASE*. Don't prepend variable names with `_` as many libraries do so, and it may create conflicts.
